## Look at your data

In this example, we're going to use global fishery catch data from [Tidy Tuesday 2021-10-12](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-10-12/readme.md).  

First: we'll read in the data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


```{r}
global_catch <- read_csv(here("data", # data is in the "data" folder in this repository
                         "global-fishery-catch-by-sector.csv")) # file name
```

Then, we can look at it using `glimpse().`

```{r}
glimpse(global_catch)
```

`glimpse()` gives similar information as `str()`: use either (or both!).

```{r}
str(global_catch)
```

```{r}
colnames(global_catch)
```

```{r}
sample_n(global_catch,
         size = 10)
```

```{r}
skimr::skim(global_catch)
```
